config ESP_PHY_CALIBRATION_AND_DATA_STORAGE
    bool "Store phy calibration data in NVS"
    default y
    help
        If this option is enabled, NVS will be initialized and calibration data will be loaded from there.
        PHY calibration will be skipped on deep sleep wakeup. If calibration data is not found, full calibration
        will be performed and stored in NVS. Normally, only partial calibration will be performed. 
        If this option is disabled, full calibration will be performed.

        If it's easy that your board calibrate bad data, choose 'n'.
        Two cases for example, you should choose 'n':
        1.If your board is easy to be booted up with antenna disconnected.
        2.Because of your board design, each time when you do calibration, the result are too unstable.
        If unsure, choose 'y'.

config ESP_PHY_INIT_DATA_IN_PARTITION
    bool "Use a partition to store PHY init data"
    default n
    help
        If enabled, PHY init data will be loaded from a partition.
        When using a custom partition table, make sure that PHY data
        partition is included (type: 'data', subtype: 'phy').
        With default partition tables, this is done automatically.
        If PHY init data is stored in a partition, it has to be flashed there,
        otherwise runtime error will occur.

        If this option is not enabled, PHY init data will be embedded
        into the application binary.

        If unsure, choose 'n'.
